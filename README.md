# Main API - Workshop 1 - System's Architecture

This repository contains the main API used by the **Perla Metro** system from the first workshop of the subject "Arquitectura de Sistemas" at Universidad CatÃ³lica del Norte. Below are the tools used and how to setup this project locally.

## Pre-requisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/es-es/download) (version 9.0.109)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (version 2.49.0)
- [Docker or Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/)

> You can run the project with the .NET SDK directly or through Docker only. Docker is recommended because it avoids installing the SDK locally.

The API depends on the following services. Ensure they are running and reachable in your environment:

- [Users Service](https://github.com/Taller-1-Arq-de-Sistemas/perla-metro-users-service)
- [Stations Service](https://github.com/Taller-1-Arq-de-Sistemas/perla-metro-station-service)
- [Routes Service](https://github.com/Taller-1-Arq-de-Sistemas/perla-metro-routes-services)
- [Tickets Service](https://github.com/Taller-1-Arq-de-Sistemas/perla-metro-ticket-service)

Each repository includes its own README with setup instructions.

## Installation and configuration

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Taller-1-Arq-de-Sistemas/perla-metro-api-main.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

```bash
cd perla-metro-api-main
```

## Configuration with Docker

1. Create a `.env.development` file from the example template and provide values that match your local services.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.development
```

Key variables:

- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`: Use `Development` for local work so Swagger is available at `/swagger`.
- `ASPNETCORE_URLS`: Listening address for the API.
- `USERS_SERVICE_URL`, `STATIONS_SERVICE_URL`, `ROUTES_SERVICE_URL`, `TICKETS_SERVICE_URL`: URLs for each downstream service.
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret used to sign and validate JWT tokens.

Once you have replaced everything, save the changes and move on to the next step.

2. Build and launch the containers

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

A Docker container would be running the web app in the port **8080**

## Configuration without Docker

1. Restore project dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

2. Initialize user secrets

```bash
dotnet user-secrets init
```

3. Seed user secrets (adjust values as needed for your environment)

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "JWT_SECRET" "568f60141067e2f67d755a45e6afa6cc0ae70fb5c687cc7a846a2d38baf678f9"
dotnet user-secrets set "USERS_SERVICE_URL" "http://localhost:3010"
dotnet user-secrets set "STATIONS_SERVICE_URL" "http://localhost:3011"
dotnet user-secrets set "ROUTES_SERVICE_URL" "http://localhost:3012"
dotnet user-secrets set "TICKETS_SERVICE_URL" "http://localhost:3013"
```

**Note (secret values)**: You can change these values to whatever you want, just make sure that these values match to the values in the entire system (like the JWT secret).

4. Run the application

```bash
dotnet run
```

The server starts at the configured address (for example, http://localhost:8080). Swagger UI is available while `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`.

These operations with their specifications can also be checked in the URI [**swagger**](http://localhost:8080/swagger) when running in the `Development` environment. The OpenAPI JSON is available at `/openapi/v1.json`.

## System architecture

This app is a part of a SOA system mentioned in the beginning (Perla Metro). It is composed by a server made in .NET like the image shown below.

<img src="./src/RMUtils/SystemArchitecture.png">

## Design patterns applied

The service uses several patterns to keep the codebase modular, testable, and maintainable:

**Layered (ControllerâService):** Separates HTTP concerns (Controllers) and application/business logic (Services). Controllers delegate to services and services makes calls to the corresponding services to handle operations.

**Dependency Injection (IoC):** All dependencies are registered and resolved via the builtâin DI container. See `AddApplicationServices` and `AddWebApp` for service lifetimes (scoped/singleton) and framework services.

**DTO (Data Transfer Object):** Public API types decouple wire contracts from domain models. Request/response DTOs live in `src/DTOs` and are validated via DataAnnotations.

**Middleware:** Crossâcutting concerns implemented as pipeline middleware, notably `ExceptionHandlerMiddleware` to catch errors.

**Configuration via Extension Methods:** Presentation/infrastructure wiring is grouped in extension methods (`AppServiceExtensions`) to keep `Program.cs` minimal and clarify composition.

**Routing Convention:** `LowercaseParameterTransformer` enforces lowercase route tokens via `RouteTokenTransformerConvention` for consistent URLs.

## Assumptions and decisions

The implementation closely follows the workshop specification with two notable adjustments:

- All endpoints except login and register require authentication.
- The station type attribute is omitted in the stations table to simplify communication between station and route services.

## Production notes

- This service is already deployed on Render and it is accessible through this URL: https://perla-metro-api-main-v1.onrender.com.
